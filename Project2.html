<h2>What is Blippy</h2>
<p>
Blippy is a AI discord bot that connects to a Gemini Ai endpoint to give real response to almost any question the user might be wondering about inside the discord.
It also has a lot of features that support many small things like birthday pings and random reposnes to messages in the discord.
