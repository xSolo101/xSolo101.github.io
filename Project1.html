<h2>What is E4Solve</h2>

<p id="projects">
Have you ever played a pokemon game? This project was designed to defeat the Elite 4 battles that happens when you finish all 8 gym battles.
This project was based on the online MMO pokemon game called PokeMMO, where there is mutliple money making methods but the one that stand above that is elite four reruns. The developers of PokeMMO have made the battles ALOT harder compared to the base game where custom strats needed to be used
to even win the battles. That's where my project came to be, it would show you, based on your team, what to do in the battle to ultimately win  
against the elite four in each region.

In This project I learned how to in real time update a react application through the webpage itself and not in the backend code. Doing so I learned
more about how react application are built.
